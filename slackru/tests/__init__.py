""" slackru unittests

    NOTE: I am not fond of keeping an empty file around but unfortunately, when
          running 'pytest' from the project's root directory, it complains when
          this file does not exist. If you can figure out a way to remove this file
          WITHOUT making it more difficult to run all unit tests at once, please do so.
