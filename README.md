# New Feature Ideas!
Be creative and liberal. It is expected that most of these features will never see the light of day so feel free to dream big.

- [ ] `@<bot> mentors` command could prompt users for a "tag" (e.g. python, java, twilio, ...). This would give the hackers a view into the internals of the mentor matching and might make for better mentor matches.
- [ ] Scrape StackOverFlow for answers to hacker questions.
- [ ] Optimize shifts based on keywords (e.g. make sure someone with Python experience is always on shift).
- [ ] How can we gather stats from first hackathon to improve next one?
- [ ] No more `@\<bot\>` to start SlackBot commands (could we use Slack "slash" commands instead?: https://api.slack.com/slash-commands).
- [ ] Identify Female Names. Match female hackers w/ female mentors when possible. Not sure if this is desirable or not. Would definitely need to get a thumbs up before implementing something like this.
- [ ] Move these ideas to the homepage of the SlackRU Flask server (which doesn't currently exist) and add a "Like" button. Track and display how many likes each idea has.

# SlackRUTest
Is the Slack workspace we use for testing. Reach out to me if you are (or want to start) helping develop SlackRU and need access (bryan.bugyi@rutgers.edu).
